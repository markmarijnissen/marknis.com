The Short Version:
==================

I am a digital nomad, an app-developer and fanatic meditator. I am constantly exploring how meditation & mindfulness transform and improve my life. I love the down-to-earth and practical approach from teachers such as Shinzen Young, Jon Kabat-Zinn and Pema Chodron.

Inspired by their teachings, I have set out to create a smartphone app that helps us practice meditation in exciting new ways.

I have been guiding meditations, I followed mindfulness courses, I took retreats, practiced in meditation groups, and I read every book about meditation and buddhism I can find. But most importantly, I’ve been practicing every day for several years now.

I hope these apps will help more people get the awesome benefits of meditation I have been expriencing!

The Long Version
================

I discovered meditation 9 years ago, when I was 15 years old. I remember one particular moment: A friend showed me her discman, and somewhere in the back of my mind, I noticed something special about the discman… but I couldn’t figure out what. A few hours later, it suddenly dawned on me: She has the same model as me!

Can you imagine? My mind was too foggy and scattered to notice such an obvious connection!

I was interested into spirituality and I read meditation makes you more aware. I tried breathing meditations, body-scans and silently repeated mantra’s. As my concentration and clarity slowly developed, my foggy brain disappeared!

Unfortunately, I did not understand meditation properly – I was using it to attain some special state, to attain a higher consciousness, to experience states of bliss and peace and what not. After a year, I felt like meditation did not “work” anymore so I stopped. After a while, I slowly began to loose my concentration and clarity. It was only then I noticed the benefits it gave me! So I’ve practiced on and off. I’ve had some more misunderstandings along the way. At some point, I tried to silence my mind by mentally screaming over any existing thoughts. “BREATH! BREATH! BREATH! BREATH!”. I didn’t have a simple thought – there was simply no time to notice any! I learned meditation is not about having no thoughts, but rather about noticing them. Over the years, through trial and error and teachings, I slowly began to develop a proper understanding of meditation.

About three years ago, I decided to take meditation seriously and practice every day. Since then, I’ve taken mindfulness courses, participated in local meditation groups and I took retreats. I have even been guiding meditation!

In the meanwhile, my interest for spirituality had faded away because nothing seemed to really work, except meditation and lucid dreaming. Later, I developed an interest in skepticism, and I’ve learned some healthy critical thinking skills from these guys! (Note that skepticism does not mean you close-mindedly reject everything, but that you are open-minded and evaluate claims based upon evidence, using critical thinking skills to spot flawed reasoning)

Scientists and meditators both try to figure out what is going on, with as much clarity and precision as they can. The scientist looks outward to our objective world, while the meditator looks inward to our subjective experience. Science is great for getting things done – and meditation is great for insight in your own habits and thoughts. At the end of the day, it is your subjective experience that determines your happiness.

That is how I come to love a down-to-earth, practical approach to meditation. Meditation should encourage you to discover what is going on, explaining everything in straight forward terms. Instead of “tuning into a higher frequency” you can just say you experienced a floating sensation in your body and had a sense of spaciousness.

Meditation has helped me in many ways. Sometimes quite simple. For example – when somebody hurried away from me – I took it personally, and thought she was an unfriendly person. Then, when I noticed these thoughts, I had a chat with her, and it turned out I was mistaken and she was actually quite friendly!

Apart from all the meditation, I have been computer programming since a kid, and I completed a bachelor in Articial Intelligence in october 2011 (at the Radboud University Nijmegen). I’ve started to work on the app, while working as a freelance webdeveloper.

In april 2012, I left my home, and I gave my stuff away (and sold some of it). Now, I am traveling the world as a digital nomad; I work while traveling the world.

After a few months of hard work, I can permit to take two months off to invest my time and energy in this app. (June and July 2012)

I love to combine my work as app-developer with my passion of mediation. I am giving my full 100% to make this happen – I really hope I can help you and everybody out there get the same awesome benefits from meditation I have been having.

Enough about me… what about you?

I’d love to hear who you are!
